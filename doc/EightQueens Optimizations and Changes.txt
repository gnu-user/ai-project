EIGHTQUEENS OPTIMIZATIONS/CHANGES
======================================

The following are changes made to my algorithm at the request of Dr. Sharyar
to experiment and see if I can improve the performance.


KILL SOLUTION CHROMOSOME REPLACE WITH RANDOM CHROMOSOME
---------------------------------------------------------

Each time a unique solution is found kill/remove that chromosome from the population
and replace it with a randomly generated chromosome.

This approach made it take on average about twice as many generations (close
to 400,000 rather than only 200,000) to find all 92 unique solutions.

The CSV file for this is attached incase you wish to plot it, it is named
replace_solution.csv




PIVOT
-----------------------

For each solution found perform a pivot operation and rotate the board three
times so that you get a total of four solutions.
