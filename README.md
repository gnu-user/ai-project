Artificial Intelligence Course Projects
========================================

The repository contains solutions to our artificial intelligence (AI) course projects.


Summary of Course Projects and Their Solutions
----------------------------------------------

1.  The first course project was to implement a solution to the [8 Queens Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_queens)
    our solution to the problem involves using a Genetic Algrorithm **(GA)** with roulette wheel selection method,
    as well as cross-over, mutation, and cloning for the operations on the chromosomes.

2.  The second project was to implement a solution to find the mimimum/optimum solution to five functions, some of
    the functions are challenging optimization problems such as [Rosenbrock's function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function)
    Our solution inolves the use of Differential Evolution **(DE)** in order to approach and optimal solution to find the
    minimum for the functions quickly.

3.  The third project involved using MATLAB's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in order to create a hypothetical marriage finder
    to help in finding the best match.


Methodology, Analysis, and Conclusions
