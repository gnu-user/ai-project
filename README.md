Artificial Intelligence Course Projects
========================================

The repository contains solutions to our artificial intelligence (AI) course projects.


Summary of Course Projects and Their Solutions
----------------------------------------------

1.  The first course project was to implement a solution to the [8 Queens Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_queens)
    our solution to the problem involves using a genetic algrorithm with roulette wheel selection method,
    as well as cross-over, mutation, and cloning for the operations on the chromosomes.

2.  The second project was to implement a solution to find the mimimum/optimum solution to five functions, some of
    the functions are challenging optimization problems such as [Rosenbrock's function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function)


Methodology, Analysis, and Conclusions
---------------------------------------

For more information on our methodology, the algorithms used, as well as our analysis and conlcusions please see
our report located in the [research](research/) directory.
