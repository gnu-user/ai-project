GA and 8-Queen Problem
=======================================

Program Execution
---------------------------------------

The Eight Queens Problem solution is a Java program, to run the program
execute the JAR file EightQueens.jar in the bin/ folder. The program will
execute and solve for all 92 solutions to the Eight Queens Problem and display
10 solutions to the problem as 10 separate windows.

You can also execute the program from the command prompt, doing so will display
all of the console output for the program, including the number of generations
required for each solution, as well as the chromosome similarity and mutation
statistics for the variable mutation due to inbreeding.

You can execute the program from the command prompt using the following command:

    java -jar EightQueens.jar

The solutions/ folder contains screenshots of 10 solutions to the Eight Queens 
Problem generated by the program.








DE and Benchmark Functions
=======================================

Program Execution
---------------------------------------

The DE and Benchmark Functions solution is a Java program, to run the program 
execute the JAR file FunctionOptimization.jar in the bin/ folder. The program will
execute and display plots of the best fitness value vs. number of function calls
(NFC) for each benchmark function.

You can also execute the program from the command prompt, doing so will display
the best fitness value average and standard deviation.

You can execute the program from the command prompt using the following command:

    java -jar FunctionOptimization.jar


Source Code 
---------------------------------------

The source code for the DE and Benchmark Functions is located in the src/ folder.
The following is an overview of the classes and source code.

  - DifferentalEvolution.java contains the main method which applies the DE
    algorithm to each of the benchmark functions.

  - ControlVariable.java contains each of the control variables, such as 
    population size and mutation rate.

  - Dejong.java, HyperEllipsoid.java, Rastrigin.java, RosenbrocksValley.java,
    and Schwefel.java are classes which implement the fitness function for
    each of the corresponding benchmark functions. Each of these classes
    implements the FitnessFunciton interface defined in FitnessFunction.java

  - Vector.java and VectorOperations.java are classes which describe the vector
    used in the DE algorithm and the vector operations such as mutation and
    crossover, which are applied to the vectors.
